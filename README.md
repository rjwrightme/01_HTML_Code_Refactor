# Homework Task 01: Code Refactor

This homework assignment required me to take a simple single page website and improve upon its accessibility. As such, I've adjusted the following:

```
1. Updated generic div tags where appropriate to use more semantic HTML5 tags
2. Added meaningful alt attributes to all image tags
3. Fixed a broken link in the navigation
4. Added a title tag with relevant page title
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
